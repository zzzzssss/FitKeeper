GymPlanner is a web application which helps find workout partners and arrange training time periods. With this application, users can find and reach out to potential workout partners with whom they share the same workout preferences and habits. In addition, users can reserve time slots of exercise machines and look up school bus schedule online, and thus have a better workout experience and time arrangement.
